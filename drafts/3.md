# Chapter 3: Sprites

## What are Sprites
A Sprite is a 2D image that can be animated or transformed by changing its
properties, including `rotation`, `position`, `scale`, `color`, etc.

## Creating Sprites
There are different ways to create Sprites depending upon what you need to
accomplish. You can create a `Sprite` from an image with various graphic formats
including: PNG, JPEG, TIFF, and others. Let's go through some create methods and
talk about each one.

### Creating a Sprite
A `Sprite` can be created by specifying an image file to use.
```cpp
auto mySprite = Sprite::create("mysprite.png");
```

```js

```

```lua

```


![](3-img/i1.png "")

The statement above creates a `Sprite` using the 'mysprite.png' image. The result
is that the created `Sprite` uses the whole image. `Sprite` has the same dimensions
of `mysprite.png`. If the image file is 200 x 200 the resulting `Sprite` is 200
x 200.

### Creating a Sprite with a Rect

In the previous example, the created `Sprite` has the same size as the original
image file. If you want to create a `Sprite` with only a certain portion of the
image file, you can do it by specifying a `Rect`.

`Rect` has 4 values: origin x, origin y, width and height.

```cpp
auto mySprite = Sprite::create("mysprite.png", Rect(0,0,40,40));
```

```js

```

```lua

```

![](3-img/i4.png "")

`Rect` starts at the top left corner. This is the opposite of what you might be
used to when laying out screen position as it starts from the lower left corner.
Thus the resulting `Sprite` is only a portion of the image file. In this case the
`Sprite`dimension is 40 x 40 starting at the top left corner.

If you don't specify a `Rect`, Cocos2d-x will automatically use the full width
and height of the image file you specify. Take a look at example below. If we use an
image with dimensions 200 x 200 the following 2 statements would have the same result.
```cpp
auto mySprite = Sprite::create("mysprite.png");

auto mySprite = Sprite::create("mysprite.png", Rect(0,0,200,200));
```

## Creating a Sprite from a Sprite Sheet
A _sprite sheet_ is a way to combine sprites into a single file. This reduces the
overall file size compared to having individual files for each `Sprite`. This means
you will significantly reduce memory usage, file size and loading time.

Also, using sprite sheets help achieve better performance by _batching_ the
_draw calls_. You will read more about this in the Advanced Chapter, but it is
one of many standard methods in the industry for increasing game performance.

When using a _sprite sheet_ it is first loaded, in its entirety, into the
`SpriteFrameCache`. `SpriteFrameCache` is a caching class that retains `SpriteFrame`
objects for future quicker access.

And a `SpriteFrame` is a object that contains the image file name and a `Rect` that
specifies the size of the sprite.

The `SpriteFrameCache` eliminates the need to load a `SpriteFrame` multiple times,
over and over. The `SpriteFrame` is loaded once and retained in the `SpriteFrameCache`

Here is an example sprite sheet:

![](3-img/3_1.png "example SpriteSheet")

It doesn't look like much but let's take a closer look at what is happening:

![](3-img/spritesheet.png "example SpriteSheet")

As you can see the _sprite sheet_, at a minimum reduces unneeded space and consolidates
all sprites into a single file.

Let's tie this all together!

### Loading a Sprite Sheet
Load your _sprite sheet_ into the `SpriteFrameCache`, probably in `AppDelegate`:
```cpp
// load the Sprite Sheet
auto spritecache = SpriteFrameCache::getInstance();

// the .plist file can be generated with any of the tools mentioned below
spritecache->addSpriteFramesWithFile("sprites.plist");
```
Now that we have a _sprite sheet_ loaded into `SpriteFrameCache` we can create
`Sprite` objects by utilizing it.

### Creating a Sprite from SpriteFrameCache
This creates a `Sprite` by pulling it from the `SpriteFrameCache`.
```cpp
// Our .plist file has names for each of the sprites in it.  We'll grab
// the sprite named, "Blue_Front1" from the sprite sheet:
auto mysprite = Sprite::createWithSpriteFrameName("Blue_Front1.png");
```

![](3-img/i3.png "")

### Creating a Sprite from a SpriteFrame
Another way to create the same `Sprite` is by fetching the `SpriteFrame` from the
`SpriteFrameCache`, and then creating the `Sprite` with the `SpriteFrame`.
Example:

```cpp
// this is equivalent to the previous example,
// but it is created by retrieving the spriteframe from the cache.
auto newspriteFrame = SpriteFrameCache::getInstance()->getSpriteFrameByName("Blue_Front1.png");
auto newSprite = Sprite::createWithSpriteFrame(newspriteFrame);
```
![](3-img/i3.png "")

### Tools for creating Sprite Sheets
Creating a _sprite sheet_ manually is a tedious process. Fortunately there are
tools that can generate them automatically. These tools can provide even more
ways to adjust your _sprite sheet_ for maximum optimization!

Here are a few tools:

* [Cocos Studio](http://www.Cocos2d-x.org/wiki/CocoStudio)
* [ShoeBox](http://renderhjs.net/shoebox/)
* [Texture Packer](https://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker)
* [Zwoptex](https://www.zwopple.com/zwoptex/)

## Sprite Manipulation
After creating a `Sprite` you will have access to a variety of properties it
has that can be manipulated.

Given:
```cpp
auto mySprite = Sprite::create("mysprite.png");
```
![](3-img/i1.png "")

### Anchor Point and Position
_Anchor Point_ is a point that you set as a way to specify what part of
the `Sprite` will be used when setting its position. _Anchor Point_ affects
only properties that can be transformed. This includes _scale_, _rotation_, _skew_.
This excludes _color_ and _opacity_. The _Anchor Point_ uses a bottom left coordinate
system. This means that when specifying X and Y coordinate values you need to make
sure to start at the bottom left hand corner to do your calculations. By default
the _Anchor Point_ of all `Node` objects is (0.5, 0.5).

Setting the _Anchor Point_ is easy:
```cpp
// DEFAULT anchor point for all Sprites
mySprite->setAnchorPoint(0.5, 0.5);

// bottom left
mySprite->setAnchorPoint(0, 0);

// top left
mySprite->setAnchorPoint(0, 1);

// bottom right
mySprite->setAnchorPoint(1, 0);

// top right
mySprite->setAnchorPoint(1, 1);
```
To represent this visually:

### Sprite properties effected by anchor point
Using _Anchor Point_ effects only properties that can be transformed. This includes
_scale_, _rotation_, _skew_.

#### Position
A _sprite's_ position is affected by its _Anchor Point_ as it is this point that is
used as a starting point for positioning. Let's visually look at how this happens.
Notice the colored line and where the _sprite's_ position is in relation to it.
Notice as we change the _Anchor Point_ values, the _sprite's_ position changes.
It is important to note that all it took was changing the _Anchor Point_ value.
We did not use a `setPosition()` statement to achieve this:

![](3-img/i9.png "")

There are more ways to set position than just _Anchor Point_. `Sprite` objects
can also be set using the `setPosition()` method.
```cpp
// position a sprite to a specific position of x = 100, y = 200.
mySprite->setPosition(Vec2(100, 200);
```

#### Rotation
Changes the _sprite's_ rotation, by positive or negative degrees. A positive value
rotates the sprite clockwise, while a negative value rotates the sprite
counter-clockwise. The default value is 0.
```cpp
// rotate sprite by +20 degrees
mySprite->setRotation(20.0f);

// rotate sprite by -20 degrees
mySprite->setRotation(-20.0f);

// rotate sprite by +60 degrees
mySprite->setRotation(60.0f);

// rotate sprite by -60 degrees
mySprite->setRotation(-60.0f);
```
![](3-img/i8.png "")

#### Scale
Changes the _sprite's_ scale, either by x, y or uniformly for both x and y.
The default value is 1.0 for both x and y.
```cpp
// increases X and Y size by 2.0 uniformly
mySprite->setScale(2.0);

// increases just X scale by 2.0
mySprite->setScaleX(2.0);

// increases just Y scale by 2.0
mySprite->setScaleY(2.0);
```
![](3-img/i5.png "")

#### Skew
Changes the _sprite's_ skew, either by x, y or uniformly for both x and y.
The default value is 0,0 for both x and y.
```cpp
// adjusts the X skew by 20.0
mySprite->setSkewX(20.0f);

// adjusts the Y skew by 20.0
mySprite->setSkewY(20.0f);
```
![](3-img/i7.png "")

### Sprite properties not affected by anchor point
There are a few properties of `Sprite` objects that are not affected by
_Anchor Point_. Why? Because they only change superficial qualities like *color*
and *opacity*.

#### Color
Changes the _sprite's_ color. This is done by passing in a `Color3B` object.
`Color3B` objects are RGB values. We haven't encountered `Color3B` yet but it is
simply an object that defines an _RGB color_. An _RGB color_ is a 3 byte value
from 0 - 255. Cocos2d-x also provides pre-defined colors that you can pick from.
Using these will be a bit faster since they are pre-defined. A few examples:
`Color3B::White` and `Color3B::Red`.
```cpp
// set the color by passing in a pre-defined Color3B object.
mySprite->setColor(Color3B::WHITE);

// Set the color by passing in a Color3B object.
mySprite->setColor(Color3B(255, 255, 255)); // Same as Color3B::WHITE
```
![](3-img/i10.png "")

#### Opacity
Changes the _sprite's_ opacity by the specified value. An opaque object is not
transparent at all. This property expects a value from 0 to 255, where 255 means
fully opaque and 0 means fully transparent. Think: "Zero opacity means invisible",
and you'll always understand how this works. The default value is 255 (fully opaque).
```cpp
// Set the opacity to 30, which makes this sprite 11.7% opaque.
// (30 divided by 256 equals 0.1171875...)
mySprite->setOpacity(30);
```
