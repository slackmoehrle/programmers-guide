# Chapter 11: Physics
Your game is coming along nicely. You have `Sprite` objects, gameplay mechanics
and your coding efforts are paying off. You are starting to feel like your game
is playable. What do you do when you realize your game needs to simulate real
world situations? You know, _collision detection_, _gravity_, _elasticity_ and
_friction_. Yes, you guessed it! This chapter is on _physics_ and the use of a
_physics engine_. Let's explore the _when_, _wheres_ and _whys_ of using a
_physics engine_.

## Physics is scary, do I really need it? Please tell me no!
Please don't run away there are no physics monsters under your bed! Your needs
might be simple enough to not need to use a _physics engine_. Perhaps a combination
of using a `Node` objects `update()` function, `Rect` objects and a combination of the
`containsPoint()` or `intersectsRect()` functions might be enough for you? Example:

```cpp
void update(float dt)
{
  auto p = touch->getLocation();
  auto rect = this->getBoundingBox();

  if(rect.containsPoint(p))
  {
      // do something, intersection
  }
}
```

This mechanism works for _very simple_ needs, but doesn't scale. What if you had
100 `Sprite` objects all continuously updating to check for intersections with
other objects? It could be done but the the CPU usage and _framerate_ would suffer
severely. Your game would be unplayable. A _physics engine_ solves these concerns
for us in a scalable and CPU friendly way. Even though this might look foreign,
let's take a look at a simple example and then nut and bolt the example,
terminology and best practice together.

```cpp
// create a static PhysicsBody
auto physicsBody = PhysicsBody::createBox(Size(65.0f , 81.0f ), PhysicsMaterial(0.1f, 1.0f, 0.0f));
physicsBody->setDynamic(false);

// create a sprite
auto sprite = Sprite::create("whiteSprite.png");
sprite->setPosition(Vec2(400, 400));

// sprite will use physicsBody
sprite->addComponent(physicsBody);

//add contact event listener
auto contactListener = EventListenerPhysicsContact::create();
contactListener->onContactBegin = CC_CALLBACK_1(onContactBegin, this);
_eventDispatcher->addEventListenerWithSceneGraphPriority(contactListener, this);
```

Even though this example is simple, it looks complicated and scary. It really
isn't if we look closely. Here are the steps that are happening:
* A `PhysicsBody` object is created.
* A `Sprite` object is created.
* The `Sprite` object applies the properties of the `PhysicsBody` object.
* A listener is created to respond to an `onContactBegin()` event.

Once we look step by step the concept starts to make sense. To better understand
all the details of a _physics engine_ you should understand the following terms
and concepts:

## Physics terminology and concepts
### Bodies
A `PhysicsBody` holds the physical properties of an object. These include _mass_,
_position_, _rotation_, _velocity_ and _damping_. `PhysicsBody` objects are the
backbone for shapes. A `PhysicsBody` does not have a shape until you attach a
shape to it.

### Material
Materials describe material attributes：

  >-density：It is used to compute the mass properties of the parent body.

  >-friction：It is used to make objects slide along each other realistically.

  >-restitution：It is used to make objects bounce. The restitution value is
 usually set to be between 0 and 1. 0 means no bouncing while 1 means perfect
 bouncing.

### Shapes
Shapes describe collision geometry. By attaching shapes to bodies, you define a
body’s shape. You can attach as many shapes to a single body as you need in order
to define a complex shape. Each shape relates to a `PhysicsMaterial` object and
contains the following attributes: _type_, _area_, _mass_, _moment_, _offset_ and
_tag_. Some of these you might not be familiar with:

  >-_type_：describes the categories of shapes, such as circle, box, polygon, etc.

  >-_area_: used to compute the mass properties of the body. The density and area
gives the mass.

  >-_mass_: the quantity of matter that a body contains, as measured by its
acceleration under a given force or by the force exerted on it by a gravitational
field.

  >-_moment_: determines the torque needed for a desired angular acceleration.

  >-_offset_: offset from the body’s center of gravity in body local coordinates.

  >-_tag_: used to identify the shape easily for developers.​ You probably remember
that you can assign all `Node` objects a tag for identification and easy access.

We describe the various _shapes_ as:
  >-`PhysicsShape`: Shapes implement the `PhysicsShape` base class.

  >-`PhysicsShapeCircle`: Circles are solid. You cannot make a hollow circle
 using the circle shape.

  >-`PhysicsShapePolygon`: Polygon shapes are solid convex polygons.

  >-`PhysicsShapeBox`: Box shape is one kind of convex polygon.

  >-`PhysicsShapeEdgeSegment`: A segment shape.

  >-`PhysicsShapeEdgePolygon`: Hollow polygon shapes. A edge-polygon shape consists
 of multiple segment shapes.

  >-`PhysicsShapeEdgeBox`：Hollow box shapes. A edge-box shape consists of four
 segment shapes.

  >-`PhysicsShapeEdgeChain`: The chain shape provides an efficient way to connect
 many edges together.

### Contacts/Joints
_Contacts_ and _joint_ objects describe how bodies are attached to each other.

### World
A _World_ container is what your physics bodies are added to and where they are
simulated. You add _bodies_, _shapes_ and _constraints_ to a world and then update
the world as a whole. The _World_ controls how all of these items interact together.
Much of the interaction with the physics API will be with a `PhysicsWorld` object.

There is a lot to remember here, keep these terms handy to refer back to them as
needed.

## Physics World and Physics Body

### PhysicsWorld
A `PhysicsWorld` object is the core item used when simulating physics. Just like
the world we live in, a `PhysicsWorld` has a lot of things happening at once.
`PhysicsWorld` integrates deeply at the `Scene` level because of it's many facets.
Let's use a simple example that we can all relate to. Does your residence have a
kitchen? Think of this as your PhysicsWorld! Now your world has `PhysicsBody`
objects, like food, knives, appliances! These bodies interact with each other
inside the world. These objects touch and also react to those touches. Example:
use a knife to cut food and put it in an appliance. Does the knife cut
the food? Maybe. Maybe not. Perhaps it isn't the correct type of knife for the
job.

You can create a `Scene` that contains a `PhysicsWorld` using:
```cpp
auto scene = Scene::createWithPhysics();
```
Every `PhysicsWorld` has properties associated with it:
 >-gravity: Global gravity applied to the world. Defaults to Vec2(0.0f, -98.0f).

 >-speed: Set the speed of physics world, speed is the rate at which the simulation
 executes. Defaults to 1.0.

 >-updateRate: set the update rate of physics world, update rate is the value of
 EngineUpdateTimes/PhysicsWorldUpdateTimes.

 >-substeps: set the number of substeps in an update of the physics world.

The process of updating a `PhysicsWorld` is called _stepping_. By default, the
`PhysicsWorld` *updates through time* automatically. This is called _auto stepping_.
It automatically happens for you, each frame. You can disable _auto steping_ of
the `PhysicsWorld` by setting `setAutoStep(false)`. If you do this, you would _step_
the `PhysicsWorld` manually by setting `step(time)`. _Substeps_ are used
to step the `PhysicsWorld` forward multiple times using a more precise time
increment than a single frame. This allows for finer grained control of the
_stepping_ process including more fluid movements.

### PhysicsBody
`PhysicsBody` objects have _position_ and _velocity_. You can apply _forces_,
_movement_, _damping_ and _impulses_ (as well as more) to `PhysicsBody` objects.
`PhysicsBody` can be _static_ or _dynamic_. A _static_ body does not move under
simulation and behaves as if it has infinite _mass_. A _dynamic_ body is fully
simulated. They can be moved manually by the user, but normally they move according
to forces. A dynamic body can collide with all body types. `Node` provides
`setPhysicsBody()` to associate a `PhysicsBody` to a `Node` object.

Lets create a static and 5 dynamic `PhysicsBody` objects that are a box shape:
```cpp
auto physicsBody = PhysicsBody::createBox(Size(65.0f, 81.0f),
						PhysicsMaterial(0.1f, 1.0f, 0.0f));
physicsBody->setDynamic(false);

//create a sprite
auto sprite = Sprite::create("whiteSprite.png");
sprite->setPosition(s_centre);
addChild(sprite);

//apply physicsBody to the sprite
sprite->addComponent(physicsBody);

//add five dynamic bodies
for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i)
{
    physicsBody = PhysicsBody::createBox(Size(65.0f, 81.0f),
    				PhysicsMaterial(0.1f, 1.0f, 0.0f));

    //set the body isn't affected by the physics world's gravitational force
    physicsBody->setGravityEnable(false);

    //set initial velocity of physicsBody
    physicsBody->setVelocity(Vec2(cocos2d::random(-500,500),
    			cocos2d::random(-500,500)));
    physicsBody->setTag(DRAG_BODYS_TAG);

    sprite = Sprite::create("blueSprite.png");
    sprite->setPosition(Vec2(s_centre.x + cocos2d::random(-300,300),
    			s_centre.y + cocos2d::random(-300,300)));
    sprite->addComponent(physicsBody);

    addChild(sprite);
}
```
The result is a stationary `PhysicsBody` with 5 additional `PhysicsBody` objects
colliding around it.

## Collision
Have you ever been in a car accident? What did you collide with? Just like with
cars, `PhysicBody` objects can come in contact. _Collisions_ are what happens when
`PhysicBody` objects come in contact with each other. When a _collision_ takes
place it can be ignored or it can trigger events to be fired.

### Filtering Collisions
Collision filtering allows you to enable or prevent collisions between shapes.
This _physics engine_ supports collision filtering using category and group bitmasks.

There are 32 supported collision categories. For each shape you can specify which
category it belongs to. You can also specify what other categories this shape can
collide with. This is done with masking bits. For example:
```cpp
auto sprite1 = addSpriteAtPosition(Vec2(s_centre.x - 150,s_centre.y));
sprite1->getPhysicsBody()->setCategoryBitmask(0x02);    // 0010
sprite1->getPhysicsBody()->setCollisionBitmask(0x01);   // 0001

sprite1 = addSpriteAtPosition(Vec2(s_centre.x - 150,s_centre.y + 100));
sprite1->getPhysicsBody()->setCategoryBitmask(0x02);    // 0010
sprite1->getPhysicsBody()->setCollisionBitmask(0x01);   // 0001

auto sprite2 = addSpriteAtPosition(Vec2(s_centre.x + 150,s_centre.y),1);
sprite2->getPhysicsBody()->setCategoryBitmask(0x01);    // 0001
sprite2->getPhysicsBody()->setCollisionBitmask(0x02);   // 0010

auto sprite3 = addSpriteAtPosition(Vec2(s_centre.x + 150,s_centre.y + 100),2);
sprite3->getPhysicsBody()->setCategoryBitmask(0x03);    // 0011
sprite3->getPhysicsBody()->setCollisionBitmask(0x03);   // 0011
```
You can check for collisions by checking and comparing _category_ and _collision_
bitmasks like:
```cpp
if ((shapeA->getCategoryBitmask() & shapeB->getCollisionBitmask()) == 0
   || (shapeB->getCategoryBitmask() & shapeA->getCollisionBitmask()) == 0)
{
   // shapes can't collide
   ret = false;
}
```
![](11-img/CollisionFiltering.gif )

Collision groups let you specify an integral group index. You can have all shapes
with the same group index always collide (positive index) or never collide (negative
index and zero index). Collisions between shapes of different group indices are
filtered according the category and mask bits. In other words, group filtering has
higher precedence than category filtering.

### Contacts/Joints
Recall from the terminology above that _joints_ are how contact points are connected
to each other. Yes, you can think of it just like _joints_ on your own body.
Each joint type has a definition that derives from `PhysicsJoint`. All joints are
connected between two different bodies. One body may be static. You can prevent the
attached bodies from colliding with each other by `joint->setCollisionEnable(false)`.
Many joint definitions require that you provide some geometric data. Often a joint
will be defined by anchor points. The rest of the joint definition data depends
on the joint type.

  >-PhysicsJointFixed: A fixed joint fuses the two bodies together at a reference
 point. Fixed joints are useful for creating complex shapes that can be broken
 apart later.

 >-PhysicsJointLimit: A limit joint imposes a maximum distance between the two
 bodies, as if they were connected by a rope.

 >-PhysicsJointPin: A pin joint allows the two bodies to independently rotate
 around the anchor point as if pinned together.

 >-PhysicsJointDistance: Set the fixed distance with two bodies

 >-PhysicsJointSpring: Connecting two physics bodies together with a spring

 >-PhysicsJointGroove: Attach body a to a line, and attach body b to a dot

 >-PhysicsJointRotarySpring: Likes a spring joint, but works with rotary

 >-PhysicsJointRotaryLimit: Likes a limit joint, but works with rotary

 >-PhysicsJointRatchet: Works like a socket wrench

 >-PhysicsJointGear: Keeps the angular velocity ratio of a pair of bodies constant

 >-PhysicsJointMotor: Keeps the relative angular velocity of a pair of bodies
 constant

### Collision detection
Contacts are objects created by the _physics engine_ to manage the collision
between two shapes. _Contact_ objects are not created by the user, they are
created automatically. There are a few terms associated with contacts.

 >-contact point: A contact point is a point where two shapes touch.

 >-contact normal: A contact normal is a unit vector that points from one shape
 to another.

You can get the `PhysicsShape` from a _contact_. From those you can get the bodies.
```cpp
bool onContactBegin(PhysicsContact& contact)
{
    auto bodyA = contact.getShapeA()->getBody();
    auto bodyB = contact.getShapeB()->getBody();
    return true;
}
```
You can get access to _contacts_ by implementing a _contact listener_. The _contact
listener_ supports several events: _begin_, _pre-solve_, _post-solve_ and _separate_.

  >-begin: Two shapes just started touching for the first time this step. Return
true from the callback to process the collision normally or false to cause physics
engine to ignore the collision entirely. If you return false, the _preSolve()_ and
_postSolve()_ callbacks will never be run, but you will still receive a separate
event when the shapes stop overlapping.

 >-pre-solve: Two shapes are touching during this step. Return false from the callback
 to make physics engine ignore the collision this step or true to process it normally.
 Additionally, you may override collision values using _setRestitution()_, _setFriction()_
 or _setSurfaceVelocity()_ to provide custom restitution, friction, or surface velocity
 values.

 >-post-solve: Two shapes are touching and their collision response has been
 processed.

 >-separate: Two shapes have just stopped touching for the first time this step.

You also can use `EventListenerPhysicsContactWithBodies`,
`EventListenerPhysicsContactWithShapes`, `EventListenerPhysicsContactWithGroup`
to listen for the event you're interested with bodies, shapes or groups. Besides this you
also need to set the physics contact related bitmask value, as the contact event
won't be received by default, even if you create the relative _EventListener_.

For example:
```cpp
bool init()
{
    //create a static PhysicsBody
    auto sprite = addSpriteAtPosition(s_centre,1);
    sprite->setTag(10);
    sprite->getPhysicsBody()->setContactTestBitmask(0xFFFFFFFF);
    sprite->getPhysicsBody()->setDynamic(false);

    //adds contact event listener
    auto contactListener = EventListenerPhysicsContact::create();
    contactListener->onContactBegin = CC_CALLBACK_1(PhysicsDemoCollisionProcessing::onContactBegin, this);
    _eventDispatcher->addEventListenerWithSceneGraphPriority(contactListener, this);

    schedule(CC_SCHEDULE_SELECTOR(PhysicsDemoCollisionProcessing::tick), 0.3f);
    return true;

    return false;
}

void tick(float dt)
{
    auto sprite1 = addSpriteAtPosition(Vec2(s_centre.x + cocos2d::random(-300,300),
      s_centre.y + cocos2d::random(-300,300)));
    auto physicsBody = sprite1->getPhysicsBody();
    physicsBody->setVelocity(Vec2(cocos2d::random(-500,500),cocos2d::random(-500,500)));
    physicsBody->setContactTestBitmask(0xFFFFFFFF);
}

bool onContactBegin(PhysicsContact& contact)
{
    auto nodeA = contact.getShapeA()->getBody()->getNode();
    auto nodeB = contact.getShapeB()->getBody()->getNode();

    if (nodeA && nodeB)
    {
        if (nodeA->getTag() == 10)
        {
            nodeB->removeFromParentAndCleanup(true);
        }
        else if (nodeB->getTag() == 10)
        {
            nodeA->removeFromParentAndCleanup(true);
        }
    }

    //bodies can collide
    return true;
}
```

### Queries
Have you ever stood in one position and looked around? You see things _near_ to
you and _far_ from you. You can gauge how close things are to you. _Physics engines_
provide this same type of _spatial query_. `PhysicsWorld` objects currently support
_point queryies_, _ray casts_ and _rect queries_.

#### Point Queries
When you touch something, say your desk, you can think of this as a _point query_.
They allow you to check if there are shapes within a certain distance of a point.
_Point queries_ are useful for things like _mouse picking_ and _simple sensors_.
You can also find the closest point on a shape to a given point or find the closest
shape to a point.

#### Ray Cast
If you are looking around, some object within your sight is bound to catch your
attention. You have essentially performed a _ray cast_ here. You scanned until
you found something interesting to make you stop scanning. You can _ray cast_ at
a shape to get the point of first intersection. For example:
```cpp
void tick(float dt)
{
    Vec2 d(300 * cosf(_angle), 300 * sinf(_angle));
    Vec2 point2 = s_centre + d;
    if (_drawNode)
    {
        removeChild(_drawNode);
    }
    _drawNode = DrawNode::create();

    Vec2 points[5];
    int num = 0;
    auto func = [&points, &num](PhysicsWorld& world,
        const PhysicsRayCastInfo& info, void* data)->bool
    {
        if (num < 5)
        {
            points[num++] = info.contact;
        }
        return true;
    };

    s_currScene->getPhysicsWorld()->rayCast(func, s_centre, point2, nullptr);

    _drawNode->drawSegment(s_centre, point2, 1, Color4F::RED);
    for (int i = 0; i < num; ++i)
    {
        _drawNode->drawDot(points[i], 3, Color4F(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f));
    }
    addChild(_drawNode);

    _angle += 1.5f * (float)M_PI / 180.0f;
}
```

![](11-img/RayTest.gif)

#### Rect Queries
_Rect queries_ provide a fast way to check roughly which shapes are in an area.
It is pretty easy to implement:
```cpp
auto func = [](PhysicsWorld& world, PhysicsShape& shape, void* userData)->bool
{
    //Return true from the callback to continue rect queries
    return true;
}

scene->getPhysicsWorld()->queryRect(func, Rect(0,0,200,200), nullptr);
```
A few examples of using a _Rect query_ while doing a *logo smash*:

![](11-img/rectQuery2.gif)


#### Disabling Physics
Using the built-in _physics engine_ is a good idea. It is solid and advanced.
However, if you wish to use an alternative _physics engine_ you can. All you need
to do is disabling `CC_USE_PHYSICS` in `base/ccConfig.h`.
