# SDKBOX

## Prerequisite
* Review the [SDKBOX](http://cocos2d-x.org/sdkbox) website and decide what plugins
you want to integrate.
* Download the __SDKBOX Installer__. If you are running Cocos2d-x v3.7, the
__SDKBOX Installer__ is already downloaded and located at __<Cocos2d-x root>/tools/cocos2d-console/plugins/plugin_package/sdkbox__.

## Why SDKBOX?
__SDKBOX__ is a new Cocos2d-x tool that allows developers to integrate popular
third party plugins for __Tune__, __AdColony__, __Age Cheq__, __Chartboost__,
__Facebook__, __Flurry Analytics__, __Google Analytics__, __In-App Purchase__,
__Kochava__, __Vungle__ and many more. __SDKBOX__ makes it super *EASY* and *FREE* for
Cocos2d-x developers to integrate 3rd party SDKs into their games by doing all
the hard, tedious and tricky work so that developers don’t have to. All services
are tested and certified. No matter which version of the game engine you are using,
C++ or Javascript or Lua, __SDKBOX__ will reduce your integration time from a typical
1~2 weeks down to less than a day. No hassle, no friction.
