#Chapter 2: Basic Cocos2d-x Concepts

This chapter assumes you've just gotten started with Cocos2d-x, and are ready to
start working on the game of your dreams. Don't worry, it will be fun!

Let's get started!

Cocos2d-x is a cross-platform game engine. A game engine is a piece of software
that provides common functionality that all games need. You might have heard this
referred to as an API or framework but in this guide, we'll be calling it a
'game engine'.

Game engines include many components that when used together will help speed up
development time, and often perform better than homemade engines. A game engine
is usually comprised of some or all of the following components: a renderer,
2d/3d graphics, collision detection, a physics engine, sound, controller support,
animations and more.  Game engines usually support multiple platforms thus making
it easy to develop your game and then deploy it to multiple platforms without
much overhead at all.

Since Cocos2d-x is a game engine, it provides a simplified API for developing
cross-platform mobile and desktop games. By encapsulating the power inside an
easy to use API, you can focus on developing your games and worry less about the
implementation of the technical underpinnings. Cocos2d-x will take care of as
much or as little of the heavy lifting as you want.

Cocos2d-x provides `Scene`, `Transition`, `Sprite`, `Menu`, `Sprite3D`, `Audio`
objects and much more. Everything you need to create your games are included.

## Main Components
It might seem overwhelming at first, but getting started with Cocos2d-x is
simple. Before we dive into depth we must understand some of the concepts
Cocos2d-x utilizes. At the heart of Cocos2d-x are `Scene`, `Node`, `Sprite`,
`Menu` and `Action` objects. Look at any of your favorite games, and you will
see all of these components in one form or another!

Let's have a look. This looks like a little very popular game you might have
played:

![](2-img/2n_main.png "")

Let's take another look, but splitting up the screenshot and identifying the
components used to build it:

![](2-img/2n_annotated_scaled.png "")

You can see a menu, some sprites and labels, which all have an equivalent in
Cocos2d-x.  Take a look at a few of your own game design documents,and see what
components you have, you'll probably have a few that match up.

## Director
Cocos2d-x uses the concept of a `Director`, just like in a movie! The `Director`
controls the flow of operations and tells the necessary recipient what to do.
Think of yourself as the _Executive Producer_ and you tell the `Director` what
to do! One common `Director` task is to control `Scene` replacements and
transitions. The `Director` is a shared singleton (effectively, there's only one
instance of the class at a time) object that you can call from anywhere in your
code.

Here is an example of a typical game flow. The `Director` takes care of
transitioning through this as your game criteria decides:

![](2-img/scenes.png "")

You are the director of your game. You decide what happens, when and how.
Take charge!

## Scene
In your game you probably want a main menu, a few levels and an ending scene.
How do you organize all of these into the separate pieces they are? You guessed
it, `Scene`. When you think about your favorite movie you can see that it's
distinctly broken down into scenes, or separate parts of the story line. If we
apply this same thought process to games, we should come up with at least a few
scenes no matter how simple the game is.

Taking another look at the familiar image from earlier:

![](2-img/2n_main.png "")

This is a main menu and it is a single `Scene`. This scene is made up of
several pieces that all fit together to give us the end result. Scenes are drawn
by the __renderer__. The __renderer__ is responsible for rendering sprites and
other objects into the screen. To better understand this we need to talk a bit
about the _scene graph_.

## Scene Graph
A __scene graph__ is a data structure that arranges a graphical scene. A
__scene graph__ contains `Node` objects in a tree (yes, it is called
__scene graph__, but it is actually represented by a __tree__) structure.

![](2-img/tree.jpg "Simple Tree")

It sounds and looks complicated. I'm sure you are asking why should you care
about this technical detail if Cocos2d-x does the heavy lifting for you? It
really is important to understand how Scenes are drawn by the renderer.

Once you start adding nodes, sprites and animations to your game, you want to
make sure you are drawing the things you expect. But what if you are not?  What
if your sprites are hidden in the background and you want them to be the
foremost objects? No big deal, just take a step back and run through the scene
graph on a piece of paper, and I bet you find your mistake easily.

Since the _Scene Graph_ is a tree; you can __walk the tree__. Cocos2d-x uses
the __in-order walk__ algorithm. An __in-order walk__ is the left side of the
tree being walked, then the root node, then the right side of the tree. Since
the right side of the tree is rendered last, it is displayed first on the
__scene graph__.

![](2-img/in-order-walk.png "in-order walk")

The __scene graph__ is easily demonstrated, let's take a look at our game scene
broken down:

![](2-img/2n_main.png "")

Would be rendered as a tree, simplified to the following:

![](2-img/2n_mainScene-sceneGraph.png "")

Another point to think about is elements with a negative __z-order__ are on the
left side of the tree, while elements with a positive __z-order__ are on the right
side.  Keep this in consideration when ordering your elements! Of course, you
can add elements in any order, and they're automatically sorted based upon a
customizable __z-order__.

Building on this concept, we can think of a `Scene` as a collection of
`Node` objects. Let's break the scene above down to see the __scene graph__ uses
the __z-order__ to layout the `Scene`:

![](2-img/layers.png "")

The `Scene` on the left is actually made up of multiple `Node` objects
that are given a different __z-order__ to make them "stack" on top of each other.

In Cocos2d-x, you build the __scene graph__ using the *addChild()* API call:

<div class="langs">
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#" id="tab-cpp">C++</a></li>
    <li><a href="#" id="tab-js">Javascript</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>
  <div class="tab-cpp tab_content">

<!-- any wording here -->
```cpp
// Adds a child with the z-order of -2, that means
// it goes to the "left" side of the tree (because it is negative)
scene->addChild(title_node, -2);

// When you don't specify the z-order, it will use 0
scene->addChild(label_node);

// Adds a child with the z-order of 1, that means
// it goes to the "right" side of the tree (because it is positive)
scene->addChild(sprite_node, 1);
```

  </div>

  <div class="tab-js tab_content">

<!-- any wording here -->
```javascript

```

  </div>

## Sprites
All games have `Sprite` objects, and you may or may not realize what they are.
Sprites are the objects that you move around the screen.
You can manipulate them. The main character in your game is probably a
Sprite. I know what you might be thinking -  isn't every graphical object
a `Sprite`? No! Why? Well a Sprite is only a Sprite if you move it around. If you
don't move it around it is just a `Node`.

Taking another look at the image from above, let's point out what are
Sprites and what are Nodes:

![](2-img/2n_main_sprites_nodes.png "")

Sprites are important in all games. Writing a platformer, you probably have
a main character that is made by using an image of some sort. This is
a `Sprite`.

`Sprites` are easy to create and they have configurable properties
like: __position__, __rotation__, __scale__, __opacity__, __color__ and more.

<div class="langs">
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#" id="tab-cpp">C++</a></li>
    <li><a href="#" id="tab-js">Javascript</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>
  <div class="tab-cpp tab_content">

<!-- any wording here -->
```cpp
// This is how to create a sprite
auto mySprite = Sprite::create("mysprite.png");

// this is how to change the properties of the sprite
mySprite->setPosition(Vec2(500, 0));

mySprite->setRotation(40);

mySprite->setScale(2.0); // sets both the scale of the X and Y axis uniformly

mySprite->setAnchorPoint(Vec2(0, 0));
```

  </div>

  <div class="tab-js tab_content">

<!-- any wording here -->
```javascript
```

  </div>

Let's illustrate each property, consider the following screenshot from
the example code for this chapter:

![](2-img/2n_level1_action_start.png "")

If we set the position using `mySprite->setPosition(Vec2(500, 0));`:

![](2-img/2n_level1_action_end.png "")

Note that the `Sprite` position has changed from its original position to the
new position that we specified.

If we now set a new rotation, using `mySprite->setRotation(40);`:

![](2-img/2n_level1_action_end_rotation.png "")

... you can see that the `Sprite` has been rotated to the new amount that was
specified.

If we now specify a new scale using `mySprite->setScale(2.0);`:

![](2-img/2n_level1_action_end_scale.png "")

Again, we can see that the `Sprite` now has changed according to our code
changes.

Lastly, all `Node` objects (since a `Sprite` is a subclass of `Node`) have a
value for __anchor point__. We haven't talked about this yet, so now is a good
time. You can think of __anchor point__ as a way of specifying what part of the
sprite will be used as a base coordinate when setting the position of it.

Using the character from our example game, and setting the anchor point to
__0, 0__ using:

<div class="langs">
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#" id="tab-cpp">C++</a></li>
    <li><a href="#" id="tab-js">Javascript</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>
  <div class="tab-cpp tab_content">

<!-- any wording here -->
```cpp
mySprite->setAnchorPoint(Vec2(0, 0));
```

  </div>

  <div class="tab-js tab_content">

<!-- any wording here -->
```javascript
```

  </div>

would result in the lower left corner of our sprite being used as the basis for
any `setPosition()` call. Let's see a few of these in action:

![](2-img/2n_level1_anchorpoint_0_0.png "") ![](2-img/smallSpacer.png "") ![](2-img/2n_level1_anchorpoint_05_05.png "") ![](2-img/smallSpacer.png "") ![](2-img/2n_level1_anchorpoint_1_1.png "")

Take a look at the red dot in each picture. This red dot illustrates where
the anchor point is!

As you can see __anchor point__ is very useful when positioning `Nodes`. You
can even adjust the __anchor point__ dynamically to simulate effects in your
game.

We really can tweak just about every aspect of the `Sprite`. But, what if we
wanted to have these same types of changes occur in an automated, time
determined manner? Well, keep reading...

## Actions
Creating a `Scene` and adding `Sprite` objects on the screen is only part
of what we need to do. For a game to be a game we need to make things move
around! `Action` objects are an integral part of every game. __Actions__ allow the
transformation of `Node` objects in time space. Want to move a `Sprite`
from one `Point` to another and use a callback when complete? No problem!
You can even create a `Sequence` of `Action` items to be performed on a
`Node`. You can change `Node` properties like position, rotation and scale.
Example Actions: `MoveBy`, `Rotate`, `Scale`. All games use __Actions__.

Taking a look at the [sample code](https://github.com/chukong/programmers-guide-samples)
for this chapter, here are __Actions__ in work:

![](2-img/2n_level1_action_start.png "")

and after 5 seconds the sprite will move to a new position:

![](2-img/2n_level1_action_end.png "")

`Action` objects are easy to create:

<div class="langs">
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#" id="tab-cpp">C++</a></li>
    <li><a href="#" id="tab-js">Javascript</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>
  <div class="tab-cpp tab_content">

<!-- any wording here -->
```cpp
auto mySprite = Sprite::create("Blue_Front1.png");

// Move a sprite 50 pixels to the right, and 10 pixels to the top over 2 seconds.
auto moveBy = MoveBy::create(2, Vec2(50,10));
mySprite->runAction(moveBy);

// Move a sprite to a specific location over 2 seconds.
auto moveTo = MoveTo::create(2, Vec2(50,10));
mySprite->runAction(moveTo);
```

  </div>

  <div class="tab-js tab_content">

<!-- any wording here -->
```javascript

```

  </div>

## Sequences and Spawns
With moving `Sprite` objects on the screen we have everything we need to create
our game, right? Not quite. What about running multiple __Actions__? Yes,
Cocos2d-x handles this too in a few different ways.

Just like it sounds, a `Sequence` is multiple `Action` objects run in a specified
order. Need to run the `Sequence` in reverse? No problem, Cocos2d-x handles
this with no additional work.

Take a look at the flow of an example `Sequence` for moving a `Sprite`
gradually:

![](2-img/2_sequence_scaled.png "")

This `Sequence` is easy to make:

<div class="langs">
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#" id="tab-cpp">C++</a></li>
    <li><a href="#" id="tab-js">Javascript</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>
  <div class="tab-cpp tab_content">

<!-- any wording here -->
```cpp
auto mySprite = Node::create()

// move to point 50,10 over 2 seconds
auto moveTo1 = MoveTo::create(2, Vec2(50,10));

// move from current position by 100,10 over 2 seconds
auto moveBy1 = MoveBy::create(2, Vec2(100,10));

// move to point 150,10 over 2 seconds
auto moveTo2 = MoveTo::create(2, Vec2(150,10));

// create a delay
auto delay = DelayTime::create(1);

mySprite->runAction(Sequence::create(moveTo1, delay, moveBy1, delay->clone(),
moveTo2, nullptr));
```

  </div>

  <div class="tab-js tab_content">

<!-- any wording here -->
```javascript
```

  </div>

This example runs a `Sequence`, in order, but what about running all the
specified __Actions__ at the same time? Cocos2d-x supports this too and it
is called `Spawn`. `Spawn` will take all the specified `Action` objects and
executes them at the same time. Some might be longer than others, so they won't
all finish at the same time if this is the case.

<div class="langs">
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#" id="tab-cpp">C++</a></li>
    <li><a href="#" id="tab-js">Javascript</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>
  <div class="tab-cpp tab_content">

<!-- any wording here -->
```cpp
auto myNode = Node::create()

auto moveTo1 = MoveTo::create(2, Vec2(50,10));
auto moveBy1 = MoveBy::create(2, Vec2(100,10));
auto moveTo2 = MoveTo::create(2, Vec2(150,10));

myNode->runAction(Spawn::create(moveTo1, moveBy1, moveTo2, nullptr));
```

  </div>

  <div class="tab-js tab_content">

<!-- any wording here -->
```javascript
```

  </div>

Why `Spawn` actions? Is there ever a reason? Sure! What if your main
character has multiple __Actions__ when obtaining a power up? Maybe beating
the boss at the end of a level has multiple __Actions__ that need to happen
to end the level.

## Parent Child Relationship
Cocos2d-x uses a __parent and child__ relationship. This means that properties
and changes to the parent node are applied to its children. Consider a single
`Sprite` and then a `Sprite` that has children:

![](2-img/2n_parent.png "")

With children, changing the rotation of the parent will also change the
rotation to all children:

![](2-img/2n_parent_rotation.png "")

<div class="langs">
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#" id="tab-cpp">C++</a></li>
    <li><a href="#" id="tab-js">Javascript</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>
  <div class="tab-cpp tab_content">

<!-- any wording here -->
```cpp
auto myNode = Node::create();

// rotating by setting
myNode->setRotation(50);
```

  </div>

  <div class="tab-js tab_content">

<!-- any wording here -->
```javascript
```

  </div>

Just like with rotation, if you change the scale of the parent the children
will also get scaled:

![](2-img/2n_parent_scaled.png "")

<div class="langs">
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#" id="tab-cpp">C++</a></li>
    <li><a href="#" id="tab-js">Javascript</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>
  <div class="tab-cpp tab_content">

<!-- any wording here -->
```cpp
auto myNode = Node::create();

// scaling by setting
myNode->setScale(2.0); // scales uniformly by 2.0
```
  </div>

  <div class="tab-js tab_content">

<!-- any wording here -->
```javascript
```

  </div>

## Logging as a way to output messages
Sometimes, when your app is running, you might wish to see messages being written
to the console for informational or debug purposes. This is built into the
engine, using __log()__. Example:

<div class="langs">
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#" id="tab-cpp">C++</a></li>
    <li><a href="#" id="tab-js">Javascript</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>
  <div class="tab-cpp tab_content">

<!-- any wording here -->
```cpp
// a simple string
log("This would be outputted to the console");

// a sting and a variable
string s = "My variable";
log("string is %s", s);

// a double and a variable
double dd = 42;
log("double is %f", dd);

// an integer and a variable
int i = 6;
log("integer is %d", i);

// a float and a variable
float f = 2.0f;
log("float is %f", f);

// a bool and a variable
bool b = true;
if b == true then
    log("bool is true");
else
    log("bool is false");
end
```

  </div>

  <div class="tab-js tab_content">

<!-- any wording here -->
```javascript
```

  </div>

And, as expected, if you prefer you can use __std::cout__ in place of __log()__,
however, __log()__ might offer easier formatting of complex output.

## Conclusion
We have gone through a lot of Cocos2d-x concepts. Take a deep breath.
Don't worry. Just dive in with your ideas and take it one step at a time.
Cocos2d-x and programming in general are not skills that are learned
overnight. These take practice and understanding. Remember that the [forums](http://discuss.Cocos2d-x.org) are also there to help you with questions.
